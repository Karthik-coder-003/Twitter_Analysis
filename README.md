# Twitter Sentiment Analysis for Hate Speech Detection
This project focuses on sentiment analysis for detecting hate speech in Twitter data. Hate speech detection is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP), especially in social media platforms where abusive and offensive language can propagate rapidly. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and NLP techniques, this project aims to classify tweets into two categories: normal and hateful.

# Key Features:
Data Cleaning: Preprocessing steps include removing noise such as special characters, numbers, and punctuation, as well as tokenization and normalization of text.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization techniques, including word clouds and bar plots, help explore the distribution of words and hashtags in both normal and hateful tweets.
Feature Engineering: Bag-of-words (BoW) and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) features are extracted to represent tweet data for model training.
# Model Building:
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest
XGBoost

Model Evaluation: F1-score is used as the evaluation metric to measure the performance of each model.
Fine-tuning XGBoost: Grid search is employed to find the optimal hyperparameters for the XGBoost classifier.

# Technologies Used:
Python
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Gensim, XGBoost
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud

# Dataset:
The dataset used in this project contains labeled Twitter data, where each tweet is categorized as either normal or hateful. It is sourced from Kaggle and consists of both training and testing data.

# Future Work:
Experiment with deep learning models such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) for improved performance.
Explore additional features such as sentiment analysis, user features, and context-based features for enhanced hate speech detection.
Deploy the trained model as a web application or API for real-time hate speech detection on Twitter or other social media platforms.
By addressing the challenge of hate speech detection, this project contributes to creating safer and more inclusive online environments.
